# Project-Euler-Rust
Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem set in Rust.

As per the [guidelines](https://projecteuler.net/about) of Project Euler, ***please*** do not copy my solutions in order to progress. My code is far from perfect and I'm sure you can do a better job than I have. If you are stuck and are looking for a little bit of direction, or you have solved a problem and just want to see how someone else approached it, then by all means; please take a look at my code.
